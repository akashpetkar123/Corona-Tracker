# Corona-Tracker
It gives the corona casess information in INDIA

This is a test project i have created, which gives you the information of corona cases in INDIA.
If you run the project and click on the Link it will give you the information such as total cases, active cases, recovered cases,
death cases etc.
It also gives you the information of recovered and death rate in terms of percentage(%).
This can also be implemented for other countries data you need tpo change the code a little bit.

I Hope you will get some idea of the project.
